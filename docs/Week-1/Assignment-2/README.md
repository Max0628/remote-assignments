Dear Kash,

This is my week-1 assignment-2. Here are the requirements:

### Assignment 2: Page Layout in Pure HTML/CSS

1. The website title/logo in the navigation bar should be aligned to the left.
2. The menu items in the navigation bar should be aligned to the right.
3. The total width of content boxes should be fixed at 1200px when the screen width is greater than 1200px.

Thank you for checking my homework. Could you please review my code and provide some feedback? I sincerely appreciate your help.

Thank you, Kash!

Best regards,  
Max
