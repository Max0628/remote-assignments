### Dear Kash,

This is my Week 2 Assignment 3 submission. Here are the requirements:

#### Assignment 3: Data Manipulation

1. **count:**  
   return an object which shows the count of each character.
2. **groupByKey:**  
   This time, you may get letters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, try to avoid using ‘if’ or ‘switch’ to split each letter into different cases (e.g., `if (letter == 'a') {...} else if (letter == 'b') {...}`), otherwise, your code will be very long.

**Note:**

- The input format is different for these two functions.
- In the second function, the input may have the same key but different values, the
  output should have each key only once.

Thank you for reviewing my homework!

**Best regards,**  
Max
