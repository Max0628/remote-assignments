### Dear Kash,

This is my Week 2 Assignment 1 submission. Here are the requirements:

#### Assignment 1: Function and Array

1. **max Function:**  
   find the max value of an array of numbers
2. **findPosition Function:**  
   find the first position of the target number inside an array of numbers.
   The position should be counted starting from 0, if you can't find the target, please return -1

**Reminder:**  
Please note that you cannot use built-in functions such as `Math.max()` or `Array.prototype.findIndex()` for this assignment. Implement the solutions manually.

Thank you for reviewing my homework!

**Best regards,**  
Max
