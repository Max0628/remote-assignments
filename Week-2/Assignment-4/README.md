### Dear Kash,

This is my Week 2 Assignment 4 submission. Here are the requirements:

#### Assignment 4: HTML DOM and Event Handling

1. **Request 1: Click to Change Text**  
   When the user clicks on the "Welcome Message" block, change the text to "Have a Good Time!".
2. **Request 2: Click to Show More Content Boxes**  
   There are some more content boxes waiting to show. When the user clicks the Call-to-Action button, show those hidden content boxes.

Hint: all content boxes are already there, they are just set to`display: none`.at the beginning.

**Reminder**

- Following the assignment in week 1, letâ€™s add some effects on it by only pure JavaScript without Bootstrap, jQuery, or any other libraries.

Thank you for reviewing my homework!

**Best regards,**  
Max
