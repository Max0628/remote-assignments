### Dear Kash,

This is my Week 2 Assignment 5 submission. Here are the requirements:

#### Assignment 5: Algorithm Practice (Advanced Optional)

Remember what we did in Assignment 1? We created a function that can find the position of the target number inside an array of numbers. Actually, if the array was Sorted already, there is a beautiful algorithm called Binary Search which can do this job efficiently. You can try to look up these keywords and learn the concept behind this algorithm. If you still have time, you can try implementing it yourself.

For simplicity, you can assume that there are no duplicate numbers in the given array. It will be a challenge if you havenâ€™t learned any algorithm before.

Thank you for reviewing my homework!

**Best regards,**  
Max
